go-indicator
============

The **go-indicator** allows you to monitor your **ThoughtWorks Go pipelines** directly from the menu bar of Ubuntu. 

It shows the status of the following:
- Your pipelines	
- The stages under each pipeline
- The jobs under each stage

You can select the pipelines that you wish to monitor. Clicking on a job will take you to the job page. You also get notifications when there is any pipeline failure.
